:: @JENKINS_MASTER_CONTAINER@:       The name of the machine to which the public key belongs.
:: @SLAVE_MACHINE_USER@:             The user account that runs the ssh server.
:: @SLAVE_MACHINE_USER_PASSWORD@:    The password for the windows user account and ssh access

:: Update the bitvise server with the new authorized key.
:: With the Bitvise SSH Server the keys in the authorized_keys file are only imported to the server when the windows user logs out. 
:: To force an immediate update, we use the Bitvise SSH Client tool spksc to register the public key with the server.
:: The synchronisation mechanism with the authorized_keys file will make sure that public keys from previous runs 
:: of this script are automatically removed from the servers public key list. This step requires to enter the password again.
