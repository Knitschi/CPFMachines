:: This script writes a given public key for a given machine to the public keys file of a given user.
::
:: Script arguments:
:: 1:                                The password for the user that is used by jenkins to ssh into the windows build slave.
::
:: Template Arguments
:: @PUBLIC_KEY@:                     The full content of the public key rsa file.
:: @JENKINS_MASTER_CONTAINER@:       The name of the machine to which the public key belongs.
:: @SLAVE_MACHINE_USER@:             The user account that runs the ssh server.

set publicKey=@PUBLIC_KEY@
set accessingMachine=@JENKINS_MASTER_CONTAINER@
set user=@SLAVE_MACHINE_USER@
set password=%1

set sshDir="C:/Users/%user%/.ssh"
cd %sshDir%
:: write the content of authorized_keys to keys_temp excluding the public key of the accessing machine
type authorized_keys | findstr /v @JENKINS_MASTER_CONTAINER@ >> keys_temp
move /y keys_temp authorized_keys
:: add the new public key to the authorized_keys file
echo %publicKey% >> authorized_keys


:: Update the bitvise server with the new authorized key.
:: With the Bitvise SSH Server the keys in the authorized_keys file are only imported to the server when the windows user logs out. 
:: To force an immediate update, we use the Bitvise SSH Client tool spksc to register the public key with the server.
:: The synchronisation mechanism with the authorized_keys file will make sure that public keys from previous runs 
:: of this script are automatically removed from the servers public key list. This step requires to enter the password again.
